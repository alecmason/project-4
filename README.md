# ProjectDev

The goal of ProjectDev is to be a Craigslist for web developers. Once a user in signed up or logged in, they may browse a list
of projects posted by other developers. Projects can range from a small mobile app to large web apps. Users can find a project they are interested in and email the user who submitted the project. A user can also post a project they want help with.
